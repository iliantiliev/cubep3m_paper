\section{Poisson Solver}
\label{sec:Poisson}


This section describes how Poisson's equation is solved
within {\small CUBEP3M}. 

It is of course possible to shut down any of these components,

Double mesh levels, equation to match them, fudge factor, kernel, 
corrected kernel, pp and extended pp, fft to solve the force.
