\section{Systematics and Accuracy}
\label{sec:systematics}

To discuss : 

1) random shift to shuffle systematic clustering at the grid scale, 

2) choice of initial redshift, which can lead to large truncation error if too early, but poor inaccurate Zel'dovich if too late 
{\bf JD, here you could discuss the ra\_max tempering...} 

3) limits of resolution caused by softening length,

4) Poisson shot noise if too few particles or unrelaxed systems, 5) finite box size effects (with beat coupling?)
 
Show plots of pairwise force (transverse and radial), density force, power spectrum, 
mention the work on covariance matrix by Ngan, Harnoisetal.
